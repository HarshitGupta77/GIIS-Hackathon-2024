# Theme: Life on All Elements

Welcome to our hackathon project, where we explore the theme **"Life on All Elements."** Our project consists of two main components: a **Carbon Footprint Calculator** and an engaging **Website** dedicated to the four elements of life: Earth, Fire, Air, and Water, along with practical suggestions for reducing your carbon footprint.

## üåç Carbon Footprint Calculator

Our Carbon Footprint Calculator is built using **React** and **Node.js**. It allows users to input their environmental data, including:
- Electricity usage (KWh/Month)
- Gasoline usage (Gallons/Month)
- Number of short and long flights taken
- Dietary choice (Vegan, Vegetarian, Non-Vegetarian)

Upon entering this information and clicking the "Calculate" button, users receive a detailed bar graph illustrating their carbon emissions across four categories: Electricity, Air Travel, Transportation, and Dietary Choice. Additionally, the tool calculates and displays total emissions per year, providing insight into individual carbon footprints.

## üî• Elements of Life Website

The website features five intuitive tabs representing the four elements and a section for suggestions:
- **Earth**
- **Fire**
- **Air**
- **Water**
- **Suggestions**

Each element tab showcases a visually appealing spline model, with hyperlinks leading to dedicated pages that explore the significance of each element. The color-coded design enhances user experience:
- Light Blue for Air
- Dark Blue for Water
- Green for Earth
- Red for Fire

The suggestions section offers actionable tips to help users reduce their carbon emissions and live more sustainably.

## üíª Interactive Experience

All webpages are designed with an interactive animation background to create an immersive experience. Each subpage includes easy navigation links back to the main page, ensuring seamless user experience.
